## Prediction of survival on the Titanic using ML classification models
- Used __Titanic data set from Kaggle__ to  built and compare a __variety of ML classifiers__ with __sckit-learn__ (logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine, random forest, voting classifier), in order to predict survival of passengers on the titanic
- Project comprised __all phases of ML work flow__ (e.g., train-test-splitting the data, data exploration, feature engineering (incl. pipelines), optimization of hyperparameters, evaluation via cross-validation) 
- Best classifier (voting classifier) is further tuned by __optimizing prediction thresholds__
