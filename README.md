# Classification of survival on the titanic
- Titanic data set from Kaggle is used for this
- Several ML classifiers are built with sckit-learn (logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, grouped/ensemble classifier)
- Project comprises all phases of ML work flow: 
    + data exploration:
    + feature engineering
    + creation of classifier 
    + optimization of hyperparameters
    + evaluation using different KPIS (cross-validation)
- All created classifiers are compared and the best one is further tuned by optimizing thresholds for classification
